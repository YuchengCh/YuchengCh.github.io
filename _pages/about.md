<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University, advised by Dr. Jiliang Tang. I received my B.A. in Economics and Mathematics and B.S. in Computer Science degrees both from Columbia University, where I built a foundation that bridges technical expertise with humanistic perspectives. My research focuses on the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and education, particularly automated assessment, fairness, and human-centered AI. I am especially interested in developing multi-agent LLM frameworks for tasks such as grading, bias detection, and supporting teacher professional development, with the goal of creating systems that are both effective and socially impactful.
